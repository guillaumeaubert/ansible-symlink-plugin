Symlink plugin for Ansible
==========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/guillaumeaubert/ansible-symlink-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/guillaumeaubert/ansible-symlink-plugin)


Synopsis
--------

This Ansible plugin allows creating symlinks while optionally backing up the destination if it already exists and it isn't a symlink. This is particularly useful to replace default configuration files, when you don't want to just overwrite the default without a way to check it again in the future.
